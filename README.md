# odin-recipes
Odin-recipes project.
For today I was practicing my html skills.
Like creating new files, adding images, and content using paragraphs, headings, ordered and unordered lists etc.
Plus a lot of git practice with “add” and “commit” commands.
Next time I will add css stuff to my website. To make it look  nicer.
